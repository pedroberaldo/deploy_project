For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
The model is a Random Forest Classifier trained to make binary predictions on a dataset. The hyperparameters of the model were tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to find the best combination for the given data.

## Intended Use
The model is intended to make binary predictions on a given dataset. The input data can be of any size, as long as it has the same features as the training data.

## Training Data
The model was trained on a labeled dataset consisting of numerical features and binary labels.

## Evaluation Data
The model's performance was evaluated on a hold-out dataset with the same feature distribution as the training data.

## Metrics
The following metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance on the evaluation data:
- Precision: 0.85
- Recall: 0.72
- F1 score: 0.78

## Ethical Considerations
It is important to consider potential biases in the training data, such as overrepresentation of certain groups. It is also important to ensure that the model's predictions are not used to discriminate against any individuals or groups.

## Caveats and Recommendations
The model's performance may vary depending on the specific distribution of the input data. It is recommended to evaluate the model's performance on new data before deploying it in production. Additionally, it is recommended to regularly monitor the model's performance and retrain it if necessary to ensure optimal performance.
